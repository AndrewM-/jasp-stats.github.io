JASP Help / User Guide
======================

*Getting Started*

JASP comes with 5 sample datasets, which are displayed by the menu File\Open\Examples
Double-clicking a sample dataset will open the sample to show the data pane on the left of screen and the results pane on the right.  Data series (Person 1, Person 2, Etc) are presented as rows.

Select a test to apply by clicking one of the icons tat the top of the screen.  The choices are:
-Descriptives;
-T-tests;
-Anova;
-Regression; and 
-Frequencies.

The descriptive statistics are the easiest to start with.  

Choose the Kitchen Rolls example dataset and click the descriptive statistics icon to open the 'control' pane.  
At the top is a list of available columns and on the top right is a list of selected columns.  Double-click on column names to move them from one list box to the other.  In the results pane, the results are immediately recalculated when column is added or removed.

By default only the main descriptive statistics are displayed.  At the bottom of the control pane is a Statistics menu that will reveal several other discriptive measures such as mode and median.  Selecting these will add them to the results pane.

Congradulations, you have now understand the user interface of JASP!
